 Online Reservation System (Java Console Application)

A simple yet functional **Online Railway Reservation System** built in Java for educational and internship purposes. This command-line application allows users to log in, make reservations, and cancel bookings through a text-based interface.

- Log into the system using a predefined ID and password
- Book train tickets by entering relevant details
- Automatically get train names based on train numbers
- Cancel an existing reservation
